# **ACE: AI-Powered Admission Chat Engine**

## **Introduction to the Project**

The Admission Chat Engine (ACE) is a dynamic and AI-powered chatbot solution developed for the Department of Technical Education (DTE), Rajasthan. This project aims to revolutionize the admission process by providing students with seamless access to essential information related to technical education, such as college details, courses offered, fees, and admission timelines.

ACE integrates advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), multilingual support, and voice interaction to enhance the user experience. It uses web scraping to gather and maintain up-to-date college data, ensuring students receive accurate information whenever needed.
